The reason why I chose to use their subscriber increase for my dataset is because they are one of my favourite Youtube channels. 

The project as it stands includes a dataset of the subscriber increase between the 31-07-15 to the 28/10/15, a period of 90 days.  
The processing sketch shows how many new subscribers subscribed to the channel for each day of the period plotted on a line graph.
The X axis details the amount of days while the y axis details the amount of new subscribers.

--This project in the future
I plan to display the data in a 3D environment in the form of bars representing each day. The size of these bars will be based on
the amount of new subscribers for that particular day. The 3D environment will be navigable using the W,A,S and D keys. 
The project will also allow the user to view the day that the most subscribers subscribed, the day the least amount of subscribers
subscribed, the average amount of subscribers joined and the standard deviation.
